# ML Models Directory

This directory stores ML models and related files for the MedTalkBuddy healthcare chatbot.

## Files

- `medical_model.h5`: Trained TensorFlow model for healthcare query classification
- `words.pkl`: Vocabulary for the model
- `classes.pkl`: Intent classes for the model
- `medical_intents.json`: Custom intents data (if available)

These files will be created automatically when the ML model is trained or can be pre-loaded from this directory.
